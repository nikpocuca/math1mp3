# Tutorial 1 

Course Website: https://ms.mcmaster.ca/~matt/1mp3/

This tutorial introduces the following topics. 

- Programming languages

- Integrated Desktop Environment (IDE)

- Starting out in Windows, Mac OSX, or Linux 

All my code and work done in tutorials will be put up on github here: https://github.com/nikpocuca/math1mp3 

*Click Download for those who do not know how to use github. 

## Programming Languages 

Just like human languages were created so that humans could communicate complex ideas between each other, programming languages were created so that humans would be able to communicate with computers. 

- Computers only understand two numbers, 0's and 1's. A light is either turned off or on. From this binary system we can extrapolate many different abstract objects like numbers, letters, pictures, audio, and even video!

For example as an exercise go to this site and copy paste the following http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/convert-text-to-binary/: 

01001000 01101001 00100000 01101101 01111001 00100000 01101110 01100001 01101101 01100101 00100000 01101001 01110011 00100000 01001110 01101001 01101011 00100000 01100001 01101110 01100100 00100000 01001001 00100000 01100001 01101101 00100000 01111001 01101111 01110101 01110010 00100000 01010100 01000001 00101110 00100000


Programming languages were created such that we can write a series of complex instructions in a humanly readable language and have a computer decipher it into binary code, and run the program.


There are many programming languages but for the purposes of this course we will be using Python 3.0+. 

## Integrated Desktop Environment 

To set up an environment for you to program in, you can use a series of the following: 

McMaster's Juypter System found here: https://mcmaster.syzygy.ca/ *Requires intrnet access*

Anaconda's Spyder IDE found here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos *You have to download and install anaconda 

PyCharm found here: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac *Make sure you download the community version. 

## Getting Started 

Most of you will either have Windows or Mac. Those who have linux I am going to assume you know most of this stuff already.

Each of these systems have their own configurations and issues setting up (This is part of the job). For the purposes of this tutorial I will only consider using McMaster's Jupyter notebook server.

##  Codelab

Codelab is an online system for teaching you programming and providing your in tutorial quizzes. It costs $25 to register.
